# Dual-Port RAM Verilog Project

This repository contains a Verilog implementation of a Dual-Port RAM module, designed to facilitate simultaneous read and write operations on separate ports. The module is suitable for various applications requiring efficient data storage and retrieval.

## Features

- Implements a dual-port RAM module with independent read and write ports.
- Supports concurrent read and write access, enhancing data processing capabilities.
- Utilizes Verilog for hardware description and implementation.
- Includes a corresponding test bench for rigorous functionality verification.

## Contents

- `dualport_ram.v`: Verilog source code for the Dual-Port RAM module.
- `dualportram_tb.v`: Verilog test bench for thorough module testing.
- `README.md`: This readme file.
